Motion-context temporal anchor / payload patch logic in this build is adapted
from NikoDemon80/ComfyUI-H3-Motion-Context:
https://github.com/NikoDemon80/ComfyUI-H3-Motion-Context

Upstream license: GPL-3.0.
The adaptation removes disk Save/Load and connects the previous sampled H3 latent
directly in RAM inside one ComfyUI DAG.

This notice describes the adapted motion-context layer. The Master Extender
also has its own disk-backed clip cache and final decoding path.

## Extender foundation

Original project: tritant/ComfyUI_MiniMax_H3_Extender

This custom build includes adapted extender, motion-context, and decode code.
The supplied source snapshot carried an Apache-2.0 LICENSE, preserved verbatim
at licenses/Apache-2.0.txt. The motion-context files additionally identify their
GPL-3.0 origin above. The combined distribution is GPL-3.0; this does not erase
the original Apache-2.0 notices or change the license of separately distributed
upstream projects.

## Changes in this distribution

The Master Extender combines two-pass PDD generation and learned 3D latent
upscaling with clip review, continuity, project controls, and final decoding.
The release prepared on 2026-09-11 blanks the initial Python and frontend prompt
defaults and supplies a sanitized workflow, requirements, and installation
documentation. Original author references in the source are retained.

"""Built-in prompt rewriter for the Master Extender.

Turns each clip's panel prompt into a MiniMax-H3 description before the run
renders anything, using the engines of the MiniMax-H3-Prompt-Rewriter pack
(an optional dependency, resolved lazily so this node imports without it):

- one ``llama-server`` per run, holding the writer GGUF (+ its mmproj) once;
- a writer that can see gets the reference pictures themselves in the planner call
  and in every clip's writer call (downscaled once, first in the user message, in a
  fixed order, so the server reads them once); there is no caption step. Reference
  videos are still captioned on that server, and cached by frame hash;
- every pending clip is written on the same server, several at a time, with
  llama.cpp's thinking budget applied to the writer only (captions never think);
- the rewritten text replaces ``clip["prompt"]``, the original is kept in
  ``clip["prompt_raw"]`` and ``clip["prompt_rewritten"]`` marks it done, so the
  next run leaves it alone until the panel restores the raw text.

Nothing here touches the render path: when ``rewrite_mode`` is off the extender
behaves exactly as before.
